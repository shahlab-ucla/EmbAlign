EmbAlign is a fully automated 3D registration framework that determines lineage identities from single embryo snapshots of nuclei positions in C. elegans. Anchoring searches on observed cell counts, EmbAlign retrieves reference templates from a spatiotemporal atlas and refines assignments using an iterative Sinkhorn alignment procedure. This approach robustly handles positional variability and arbitrary orientations in both live and fixed uncompressed embryos.
